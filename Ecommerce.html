         <h2>What is electronic commerce?</h2>        
         <p>The process of electronic commerce grew in popularity and was used by most businesses in the USA due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. The majority of the population had to adapt to a more digital lifestyle to prevent the outbreak from progressing, so they had to turn to digital or online channels instead. While it was convenient for businesses to go into a more digital lifestyle, many businesses that could only perform service through their physical stores had to shut down or could only offer limited products and services <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commtr.2023.100091">(Luo, et al., 2023)</a>.</p>        
         <h3>Applications in the Real World</h3>        
         <p>The adoption of electronic commerce is important in advancing entrepreneurship orientation and performance around the globe. Electronic commerce has changed the way we look at running a business and the more advanced our world is, the more competition there will be. It is an effective tool that helps the business become efficient while also increasing sales, enhancing inventory, and improving the customer’s experience with the business <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21665095.2021.1976657" >(Yacob et al., 2021)</a>.</p>        
         <p>An example of electronic commerce that is popular among the public is the website domain ‘Amazon’. This is an online platform wherein customers can search for products they are interested in and add multiple products to their virtual carts. Once all products are in the virtual cart, the customer can check out and make an online transaction which then gets delivered to their address. </p>        
         <h3>Recommendations</h3>        
         <p>The advancement of electronic commerce has its advantages which benefit the community, but it also has its disadvantages such as controlling the pollution delivery carrier services which can be done better. A way to solve this problem is to turn petrol-powered delivery carrier vehicles into electrically powered ones. Through this, we can cut off global emissions. We have already made advancements such as solar-powered technology, so it is a good idea to incorporate that. Another idea would be to have multiple businesses make use of one carrier as it is better to have one carrier working for multiple businesses than multiple businesses using their own carriers. This would also solve the problem of having additional fees such as service and delivery fees because only a few carriers would be in use, which does not spike the prices.</p>
